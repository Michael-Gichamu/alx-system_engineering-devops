# Web infrastructure design

This project was an overview of web infrastructure design.

## Learning Objectives.
* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

I conducted research on different design principles, I
whiteboarded diagrams of a developing web infrastructure. I started with a
simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured
system.

Files in this project contain links to each respective whiteboard diagram.
